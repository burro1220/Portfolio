Long lists don/'t make for a good user experience. To make it easier for the user to find information and read the page, I added a popular web development technique known as /'pagination/'. All improvements adhere to /'progressive enhancement/'. This means that the page is not dependent on the JavaScript added, and all functionality is present to a user with JavaScript disabled in their browser. The solution is dynamic, and works with a list of any number of students. As a bonus, a search input field is dynamically added, giving the user the ability to filter users by name. Pagination dynamically changes the number of appended links dependent upon the number of pages needed to show the results. Finally, custom CSS rules have been added to give my project a personal flair.",
